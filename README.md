# What is this ?

This helps user to shift a letter from a word from left to right, by any number of times user wants and can be applied to string of any length.

# Installation

` npm i ShiftByLetters `

# How to use ?

` import { ShiftLetters } from 'letter-shift' `

` ShiftLetters('Hello World Gaurav Tidke', 5);`

# Output --> 3.
 
 After shifting each word from string 5 times string will look like
 Hello World auravG Tidke
So 3 words remain same even after shifting.

Happy Coding
